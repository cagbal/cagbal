### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I am Ã‡aÄŸatay.

Spoiler alert: it is not Ka-ga-tay. It is more like "cha-tay". "Ã‡" is like "ch" in English, or "Tsch" auf Deutsch. "ÄŸ" is really hard, so you can skip it.

Github suggested that I add some interests of mine, so let's add some:

- ğŸ”­ I'm currently working on improving my ranking at Dota 2.
- ğŸŒ± I'm currently trying to combine NLP and CV on a robot.
- ğŸ¤” I'm looking for help with 1 min. Bullet Chess. My clicks are too slow, need to be improved..
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about the things that I would like to ask you about.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: By catching me on the streets of BÃ¶blingen and Stuttgart.
