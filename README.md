### Hi there 👋 I am Çağatay.

Spoiler alert: it is not Ka-ga-tay. It is more like "cha-tay". "Ç" is like "ch" in English, or "Tsch" auf Deutsch. "ğ" is really hard, so you can skip it.

Github suggested that I add some interests of mine, so let's add some:

- 🌱 I'm currently working on integration of foundation models for robotics into the industry.
- 🤖 I'm currently working on agentic AI on the robots. 
- 📽 I have a YouTube channel with over 14K subs. It is in Turkish and about techology and its monetization.
- 🤔 I'm looking for help with 1 min. Bullet Chess. My clicks are too slow, need to be improved.
- 📫 How to reach me: By catching me on the streets of Böblingen and Stuttgart.
- 🔭 I'm currently working on improving my ranking at Dota 2.
- 🐶 We have a lovely, playful, kind, and not so small family member, Biber. He is a red-rust doberman.
